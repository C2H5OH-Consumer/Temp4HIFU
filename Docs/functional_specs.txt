## WHO IS THE USER AUDIENCE
- User who wants to predict the temperature output of a specific focused ultrasound treatment regime. 
- User who wants to validate the temperature output of a specific focused ultrasound treatment regime. 
- User who wants to confirm that the temperature output of a specific focused ultrasound treament regime is within FDA compliance for medical human tissue temperature increase. 
- User who wants a GUI, a.k.a plug and play program (download and is useable)


## WHAT INFORMATION USERS WANT FROM SYSTEM
- The approximated pressure or intensity field based on ultrasound parameter inputs.
- The approximated pressure or intensity at a specific point of interest in space. 
- The calculated temperature at a specific point of interest in space, for a specific time. 
- If the calculated temperature at a specific point in space and time is within FDA compliance for medical human tissue temperature increase. 


## USE CASES
- Calculate pressure field when provided a set of inputs (pulse reime, transducer properties)
- Change point of interest on 2D map (indices for XY in space)
- View intensity or pressure value at point of interest on 2D map
- Change point of interest on 1D graph (indices for time)
- View temperature at point of interest on 1D graph
- See if temperature at point of interest is within FDA compliance for medical human tissue temperature increase.
