## Dash and Plotly
- Provides Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    - User interface to mouse over a point of interest on the pressure field.
    - User interface to change time scale for temperature graph


## Matplotlib (?)
- Used to display graph of the temperature change over time for a specific point of interest defined by the user. 


## Python Functions
- Intensity Field  
    - INPUT: Ultrasound Parameters (pulse reime, transducer properties)
    - OUTPUT: Acoustic Intensity for a pixel (2D matrix of doubles for indices in XY space)

- Bioheat Equation
    - INPUT: Acoustic Intensity (2D matrix of doubles for indices in XY space)
    - OUTPUT: Temperature for a voxel (3D matrix of doubles for indices in XY space and time) 

- Temperature Compliance 
    - INPUT: Temperature (double)
    - Test if Temperature is above or below FDA compliance for medical human tissue temperature increase.
    - OUTPUT: "Is within" or "Is not within" or T/F output

- Popup Box 1
    - Interacts with Dash
    - For a specific point of interest on pressure field, display XY coordinates and intensity value

- Popup Box 2
    - Interacts with Matplotlib 
    - For a specific point of interest on temperature graph, display temperature for specific time and FDA compliance T/F
